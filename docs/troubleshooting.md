# Troubleshooting

Symptoms and fixes for the simulation itself, on every platform. Setup
problems specific to one host belong on that host's page:
[macOS](setup-macos.md), [Windows](setup-windows.md).

## Clean restart

`Ctrl-C` normally shuts a terminal's launch down cleanly, but a killed
terminal or a crashed Gazebo can leave orphan processes behind. Symptoms
and the matching fix, in order:

1. **T1 won't start / `spawn_entity` hangs on `Waiting for service
   /spawn_entity` / Gazebo complains the master port is in use** — an old
   Gazebo is still running:
   ```bash
   pkill -9 -x gzserver; pkill -9 -x gzclient
   ```
2. **`ros2 node list` shows nodes you did not start (or duplicates), the
   robot chases exploration goals with everything closed** — orphan
   course/Nav2 nodes survive:
   ```bash
   pkill -9 -f 'detector_node|localizer_node|coordinator_node|semantic_memory_node|semantic_map_memory_node|semantic_query_node|nav_goal_adapter_node|frontier_detection_node|goal_assignment_node|startup_map_warmup'
   pkill -9 -f 'slam_toolbox|nav2|lifecycle_manager|bt_navigator|controller_server|planner_server|behavior_server|smoother_server|waypoint_follower|velocity_smoother|map_saver'
   pkill -9 -x rviz2; pkill -9 -x robot_state_publisher
   ```
3. **Ghost topics/nodes still listed after everything is dead** — stale
   discovery cache:
   ```bash
   ros2 daemon stop        # restarts automatically on the next ros2 command
   ```

Then re-open T1–T5 in order as above. Verify the slate is clean with
`ros2 node list` (should be empty or error out).

## Robot spins on the spot and never drives

**Symptom.** The robot rotates in place indefinitely instead of exploring,
and T2 repeats:

```text
[controller_server] [ERROR] Failed to make progress
[controller_server] [WARN]  [follow_path] [ActionServer] Aborting handle.
```

Frontier goals keep being accepted, `/cmd_vel` carries a non-zero
`angular.z` with `linear.x` stuck at 0, and nothing is actually in the way —
`ros2 topic echo /scan` shows metres of clear space all round.

**This is not caused by your code.** It is an occasional wedge in the Nav2
controller/recovery loop; it happens with the reference detector too, and it
can occur before the detector has published anything at all. Nothing in
`detector_core.py` can cause it or fix it — the detector is not in the
control loop.

**Fix.** `Ctrl-C` every terminal and run the clean-restart procedure
above, then re-open T1–T5 in order. It clears on restart. The map and any
landmarks built so far are lost, so the robot re-explores from scratch.

Do **not** try to fix this by lowering `conf_threshold` or widening
`class_filter` — they are unrelated; see [NOTES.md](../NOTES.md).

## `go to chair` keeps failing and RViz shows a `trash_can` marker on the chair

**Symptom.** The person and the trash can are found and reached, but the
chair never appears as `chair_0`; instead a second trash-can marker
(`trash_can_1`) sits where the chair is, and `go to chair` ends in
`query failed: no active chair in memory`.

**This is a known issue, not your code.** From some viewpoints the shipped
detector labels the chair as a trash can with high confidence; if that wrong
label reaches the promotion threshold first, the semantic map memory keeps
it and suppresses the chair for the rest of the run. It happened in 0 of 8
reference runs with the shipped settings, so it is rare, but it does occur.
Details and the mechanism are in [NOTES.md §8.1](../NOTES.md).

**Fix.** Run the clean-restart procedure above and start a fresh round; the
map and landmarks are rebuilt and the chair is normally found within about
two minutes. Do not raise `candidate_timeout` to work around it — that makes
the ghost more likely, not less.
